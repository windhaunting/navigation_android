Project decription:

we implemented a localization and wayfinding application in in Java for
android based smart phones and tablets which is used for navigation
inside the buildings. The localization is based on the data collected from
some bluetooth low energy tags which are well placed in the first floor
of a building. 

The system catches the signals coming from all
the beacons in its range and estimates the distance to each of them.
Using the distance from the three nearest tags we could find our location
related to the location of those tags and by knowing the absolute location
of those tags we could find our location. 

After finding our location, we develop a navigation algorithm for navigate through the building
to any desirable location.
